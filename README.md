##
INSTALLATION

This repository provides a detailed guide on installing and configuring OmniOS, a UNIX-based server operating system derived from illumos (inspired by OpenSolaris). The documentation covers essential topics including system requirements, step-by-step installation procedures, and common troubleshooting solutions.

The document also discusses the role of virtualization in modern computing and explains why OmniOS is well-suited for server, enterprise, and virtualized environments. The content is prepared for academic submission, practical learning, and exam-oriented understanding.

## SYSTEM-LEVEL CONCEPTS

This repository includes explanations and practical demonstrations of core operating system concepts relevant to OmniOS, such as Process and memory management (including virtual memory concepts), file systems with emphasis on ZFS, efficient I/O handling in UNIX-based systems and basic system administration and configuration tasks


Where applicable, examples are provided using C programs and standard UNIX system interfaces to demonstrate how applications interact with the operating system at a low level (e.g., memory mapping concepts using mmap() on illumos-based systems).
